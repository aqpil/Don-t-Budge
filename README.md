## Overview

I found myself regularly calculating my budget in a specific way using a basic calculator. So I thought - why not create a tool that mirrors exactly how I think about my expenses?

**Don’t Budge** is a lightweight budget calculator designed with that idea in mind. Everything from the logo to the floral patterns was custom-made. The project is fully responsive, working smoothly across desktops and mobile devices, and was built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### What I Learned

This project was a full start-to-finish experience — from naming the app and choosing fonts, to building a responsive layout and writing custom logic for budget calculations.

The highlight for me was developing a custom input flow and ensuring that user-entered values were handled intuitively and accurately within the interface.
